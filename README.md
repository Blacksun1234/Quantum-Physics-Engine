# Quantum Physics Engine

This is a simple physics Engine that I made. It supports
- Gravitiy
- Frame independence
- Collisions (AABB and Broadphase)
- Magnetic forces
- Springs ( Explicit Euler, Semi-explicit Euler and RK4 integrators)

The programm is build on 5 scenes:
- Scene 1 shows gravity

- Scene 2 shows Magnetism
